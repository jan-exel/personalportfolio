            	<p>My name is Janice Exel and I am a second year Computer Science student at Georgian College. My specializations would include computer proramming, web development, and database management. I have one year of experience in all three fields and offer an artistic, dynamic approach when it comes to creating programs and solving problems. I have a passion for the industry and love my field of work; I love working in teams, working independantly, creating new projects, refining old ones and troubeshooting problems.</p>
                <p>In 2013, I made Dean's List at Georgian College and I was one of three in my entire program invited to the Waves of Change Leadership Conference. I attended different workshops including Team Building and Job Preparation.</p>
                <p>My interests would include microcontrollers and microcomputers, mobile development, music, literature and mathematics. I love to read and learn in my spare time and find new technologies very endearing. I am eager to embark on my career in the Computer Industry; I am excited to offer my skills, critical thinking and personal flare in my field. Please check out some of my previous projects on my <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>!</p>
